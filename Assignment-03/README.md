## Assignment 03
## Assignment 03: Looping Statements in Python

## Course Details
- Course Name: Python Programming Lab (MCA31PC06)
- Batch: B3
- Academic Year: 2025–26 (Semester I)

## Aim
To understand and implement looping statements in Python for repetitive execution of code.

## Description
This assignment focuses on looping concepts in Python using for and while loops. It includes programs that perform repeated calculations, pattern generation, and iterative problem-solving.

The assignment helps in understanding control flow and efficient execution of repetitive tasks.

## Programs Covered
1. Print numbers from 1 to n using a loop
2. Find sum of first n natural numbers
3. Print multiplication table of a given number
4. Find factorial of a number using loop
5. Reverse a number using loop
6. Check whether a number is a palindrome
7. Generate Fibonacci series
8. Count digits in a number
9. Print star patterns using loops
10. Find prime numbers within a given range

## Files Included
- Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) containing Python programs
- PDF file (.pdf) containing executed output and results

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code

## Outcome
After completing this assignment, I developed a strong understanding of looping statements and learned how to solve repetitive and pattern-based problems efficiently using Python.
