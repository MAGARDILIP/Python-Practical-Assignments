## Assignment 01
## Assignment 01: Control Structures in Python

## Course Details
- Course Name: Python Programming Lab (MCA31PC06)
- Batch: B3
- Academic Year: 2025–26 (Semester I)

## Aim
To understand and implement Python control structures such as if, if-else, if-elif-else, and loops for solving basic programming problems.

## Description
This assignment focuses on the practical implementation of control structures in Python.
It includes programs that use conditional statements and loops to solve real-world logical problems such as number comparison, prime number checking, calculator operations, list processing, and decision-based classifications.

The assignment helps in developing logical thinking and understanding how control flow works in Python programs.

## Programs Covered
The assignment includes the following programs:
1. Largest of two numbers
2. Prime number check
3. Simple calculator using if-elif-else
4. Largest element in a list
5. Sum and difference of two numbers
6. Temperature conversion (Fahrenheit ↔ Celsius)
7. Number classification (positive, negative, zero)
8. Leap year check
9. Grade calculation based on marks
10. Divisibility check by 3 and 5

## Files Included
- Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) containing Python source code
- PDF file (.pdf) containing executed output and results

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code

## Outcome
After completing this assignment, I gained hands-on experience with Python control structures and improved my problem-solving skills using conditional logic.
