## Assignment 02
## Assignment 02: Conditional Statements in Python

## Course Details
- Course Name: Python Programming Lab (MCA31PC06)
- Batch: B3
- Academic Year: 2025–26 (Semester I)

## Aim
To understand and implement conditional statements in Python for decision-making and problem-solving.

## Description
This assignment focuses on the use of conditional statements in Python such as if, if-else, and if-elif-else. It includes programs that perform comparisons, decision-based operations, and logical evaluations.

The assignment helps in developing logical thinking and understanding how programs behave under different conditions.

## Programs Covered
1. Check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero
2. Check whether a number is even or odd
3. Find the largest of two numbers
4. Find the largest of three numbers
5. Check whether a year is a leap year
6. Check whether a number is divisible by another number
7. Check whether a character is a vowel or consonant
8. Calculate electricity bill based on units consumed
9. Find grade of a student based on marks
10. Simple calculator using conditional statements

## Files Included
- Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) containing Python programs
- PDF file (.pdf) containing executed output and results

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code

## Outcome
After completing this assignment, I gained a clear understanding of conditional statements in Python and learned how to apply decision-making logic to solve basic programming problems.
